## About Is It Safe?

What Is It Safe? is a non-profit project that seeks to promote the safety of the LGBTQIAP+ community through technology.

Our first project is an application of the same name that is being developed with voluntary assistance. The application is a social network whose platform aims to provide a space where its users can share their experiences, positive or negative, in a certain place or establishment so that it serves as a reference and the rest of the community can identify such place as safe or not. .

The application facilitates the exposure of situations that are very common to the community. In a safe, centralized way that protects the user's identity, the user can have more freedom to share their experiences.

In a reality where Brazil is one of the most harmful countries to the LGBTQIAP+ community, it is necessary to create digital solutions, or not, that promote its protection, security and rights.

### Our Goals

Our main objective is to create technological solutions that focus on the safety of the LGBTQIAP+ community.

### Our Values

Our values consist of: evolution, joint growth, commitment, transparency, security and respect.

### Our Mission

Our mission is to promote a space where community members can access to seek safe environments, places where the community can be who it is, without fear and share their experiences.

## How did we come to be?

The project emerged in mid-June 2021, initially designed as a university project by Ester Mabel. The idea of creating a project with these characteristics came from a personal need that was experienced and perceived by her when going through situations of LGBTQIAP+phobia on a daily basis.

So, after teaming up with a small team of friends, the first scope of Is It Safe? was created and amplified in the months that followed. With the need for more people to collaborate, we created a page on Atados, where most of our current volunteers found us and we started to plan our scope further and refine the idea.

The ensuing months have been a lot of hard work and effort. We are working hard to be able to launch our first version of the app and we have an amazing team collaborating with this whole process.
